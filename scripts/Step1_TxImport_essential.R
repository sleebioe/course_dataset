# Introduction to the Step 1 script----
# Step 1 Learning Objectives:
# 1 - Step 1 serves as your gateway to R scripts and, as such, you will learn the proper 'anatomy' for any R script.
# 2 - Learn how to install packages and load libraries into your R environment
# 3 - Understand the various file types that describe RNAseq data and how to import these files (e.g. kallisto read mapping data) into R
# 4 - Learn basic tools for annotation

# Notes:
# This script is organized into 'chunks' of code, and the final chunk (called 'the essentials') is a minimal representation of this script.

# load packages----
library(rhdf5) # provides functions for handling hdf5 file formats (kallisto outputs bootstraps in this format)
library(tidyverse) # provides access to Hadley Wickham's collection of R packages for data science, which we will use throughout the course
library(tximport) # package for getting Kallisto results into R
library(ensembldb) # helps deal with ensembl
library(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86) # replace with your organism-specific database package
library(biomaRt) # an alternative for annotation
library(beepr) # just for fun
library(datapasta) # paste data into R

# read in your study design ----
#there are LOTS of ways to read data into R, but the readr package (from tidyverse) is one of the simplest
targets <- read_tsv("studydesign.txt")

# you can easily create file paths to the abundance files generated by Kallisto using the 'file.path' function
path <- file.path(targets$sample, "abundance.tsv") # set file paths to your mapped data

# now check to make sure this path is correct by seeing if the files exist
all(file.exists(path)) 
# this should look familiar from your homework
# the functions which(), any() and all() take logical vectors as their argument. The any()
# function will return TRUE if one or more of the elements in the logical vector is TRUE. The all() function
# will return TRUE if every element in the logical vector is TRUE.

# get annotations using organism-specific package ----
Tx <- transcripts(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86, columns=c("tx_id", "gene_name"))
Tx <- as_tibble(Tx)
#need to change first column name to 'target_id'
Tx <- dplyr::rename(Tx, target_id = tx_id)
#transcript ID needs to be the first column in the dataframe
Tx <- dplyr::select(Tx, "target_id", "gene_name")

# import Kallisto transcript counts into R using Tximport ----
# copy the abundance files to the working directory and rename so that each sample has a unique name
Txi_gene <- tximport(path, 
                     type = "kallisto", 
                     tx2gene = Tx, 
                     txOut = FALSE, #How does the result change if this =FALSE vs =TRUE?
                     countsFromAbundance = "lengthScaledTPM",
                     ignoreTxVersion = TRUE)

#take a look at the type of object you just created
class(Txi_gene)
names(Txi_gene)

# if you want to write your counts or TPM to a file on your harddrive
# if you exported transcript level data and want to append your gene symbols to the data frame
# Txi_trans <- as_tibble(Txi_trans$counts, rownames = "target_id")
# Txi_trans <- left_join(Txi_trans, Tx)
